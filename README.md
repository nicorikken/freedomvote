# Installation
## The "hard" way
Requirements:

* python 2.7
* postgresql
* python-pip

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all requirements.

Configure your DB settings in `app/settings.ini`:

```ini
[DB]
NAME = freedomvote
USER = freedomvote
PASS = ***********
PORT = 5432
HOST = 127.0.0.1
```

and then run:

```bash
$ psql -h <db_host> -U <db_user> <db_name> < tools/docker/cache_table.sql
$ python app/manage.py migrate
$ python app/manage.py createsuperuser
$ python app/manage.py runserver
```

Now you can access the frontend on http://localhost:8000

### Postgresql on Debian

`sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-client`

```bash
$ sudo -u postgres bash
$ cd /
$ createuser freedomvote -P -d -g postgres
$ createdb -O postgres freedomvote
```

## The easy way - Docker
To run Freedomvote in a docker container, you need to install docker and docker-compose and execute those commands:

```bash
$ make docker-init docker
```
Default user is `admin` with password `123qwe`, to change this, run `make docker-pw`

Now you can access the frontend on http://localhost:8000

# Languages
The whole application is multilingual. Per default the languages German, Italian and French are installed.
The translation are located in `app/locale/<lang_code>/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`. After editing the translation, run `python manage.py compilemessages`

To install another language (English in this example) make the following steps:

`app/freedomvote/settings.py`
```python
LANGUAGES = (
  ...
  ...
  ('en', _('english')),
)
```
then create a new folder for the language:
```bash
$ mkdir app/locale/en
```
now run those commands in your environment:
```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
$ python manage.py makemessages
$ python manage.py compilemessages
```
or with docker:
```bash
$ make docker-makemigrations
$ make docker-migrate
$ make docker-makemessages
$ make docker-compilemessages
```
